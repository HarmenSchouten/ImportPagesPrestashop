# ImportPagesPrestashop
Module to import your categories, products, features and images from Prestashop

New feature available! If you've used this module before and you're know importing/updating the data again, you dont have to
follow the steps. You can just click 'Import Images' or another button and you can continue. Also added a 
icon with this update to the module. I also added some code to the function that makes field with multi-language.
If you imported first everything in single land, and now want to import it in multi-lang. The same fields are used, 
but the type will change to multi-language. So fieldtype 'Text' will be 'TextLanguage'. Added link to module info for more 
information.

Added options to import the EAN-numbers and the reference code for products too. If you choose to import them, they will be imported together with the products.

Code update! If you wanted to import your products etc only in your default PW language, it is now available! You can choose whether to import for as much languages as possible, or for only your default language.

Updated the code. There is now the possibility to choose how you want to import the features. 
You can choose for the faster import -> imports the features in a textarea field
Or you can choose for the slower import, but more clearer import -> Imports the features in the ProField: Table.

Code is updated. Categories are now imported correctly
