Code update! If you wanted to import your products etc only in your default PW language, it is now available! You can choose whether to import for as much languages as possible, or for only your default language.

Updated the code. There is now the possibility to choose how you want to import the features. 
You can choose for the faster import -> imports the features in a textarea field
Or you can choose for the slower import, but more clearer import -> Imports the features in the ProField: Table.
